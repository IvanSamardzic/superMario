            <h2>Welcome To My Society!</h2>
            <p>Super Mario is a platform game series created by Nintendo, featuring their mascot, Mario. Alternatively called the Super Mario Bros. series or simply the Mario series, it is the central series of the greater Mario franchise. At least one Super
                Mario game has been released for every major Nintendo video game console. There have also been a number of Super Mario video games released on non-Nintendo gaming platforms. There are currently twenty-one similar games and one cross-series
                game that may or may not be included as part of the series.</p>

            <p>The Super Mario series is part of the greater Mario franchise, which includes other video game genres and media such as film, television, printed media, and merchandise. Over 330 million Super Mario games have been sold worldwide, making it
                the third-bestselling video game series, behind the larger Mario series, Nintendo's Pokémon series and the puzzle series Tetris.</p>
